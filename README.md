# chroma-sync
`chromasync` takes an 18-colors color palette and generates themes for
various CLI tools, to make themes consistent between applications.

> NOTE: `chromasync` is still under development. I still have to do
> all the testing and clean the code!
> If you find any bug, just let me know. Any help is much appreciated



## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danieleln/chroma-sync.git
cd chroma-sync
pip install .
chromasync -h
```



## chroma-sync Directories
```
$HOME
│
├── .config/chromasync/
│    │
│    ├── chromasync-post.sh
│    │
│    ├── palettes/ 
│    │

│
└── .cache/chromasync/

     └── out/ 
```

Where:

- `chromasync-post.sh` is a shell script that is executed every
  time after chromasync finishes to run. It's useful to make other
  application to reload the theme (such as kitty, fish)
- `palettes/` contains palette files (which are `.conf` files)
- `templates/` contains config templates for the CLI tools that
  you need
- `out/` contains specialized template files generated by `chromasync`
- `chromasync.log` log file generated by the latest `chromasync` run



## Usage
```bash
# Loads a palette either from '~/.config/chromasync/palettes' or from
# anywhere in the filesystem. In the first case, file extension might
# be omitted
chromasync load "palette"

# Lists palettes in ~/.config/chromasync/palettes/
chromasync list -p

# Lists templates in ~/.config/chromasync/templates/
chromasync list -t
```

At the moment, templates and palettes must be manually placed in the 
respective folders.




## Palette files
Palette files contains the 18 colors used to theme the terminal (one
background color, one foreground color, 8 normal colors and 8 highlight
colors).

Palette files should look like this:
```conf
# one-half-dark.conf
[Palette]

# Background and foreground colors
BG=#282c34
FG=#dcdfe4

# Normal colors
BLK=#282c34
RED=#e06c75
GRN=#98c379
YLW=#e5c07b
BLU=#61afef
MAG=#c678dd
CYN=#56b6c2
WHT=#dcdfe4

# Highlight colors
BLKH=#5d677a
REDH=#e06c75
GRNH=#98c379
YLWH=#e5c07b
BLUH=#61afef
MAGH=#c678dd
CYNH=#56b6c2
WHTH=#dcdfe4
```
Note that the section header `[Palette]` is mandatory and all colors
must be defined.



## Template files
Template files don't have a general standard to follow, since they
depends on the particular application.
They just contain placeholders for chromasync to know where to place
colors and which color to place.

A simple template file might look something like this:
```conf
@fmt: hex
@out: ~/.config/my-app/my-app.conf

# template file for application my-app
background_color={BG}
foreground_color={FG}
important_text_color={RED}
inactive_text_color={FG:70:BG}
```

### Basic Colors Placeholders
Colors can be specified with `{COLOR_NAME}` where color name must be:

- one of the 18 colors defined in the palette (`BG`, `FG`, `RED`, `REDH`, etc.)
- one of `OS1`, `OS2`, `OS1H`, `OS2H`. This are Operating-System specific
  colors: they're still extracted from the 18 previous colors, but they
  change between distros.

  For example, on Ubuntu `OS1` is `RED`, while on Arch `OS1` is `CYN`.
  `OS1H` is the highlighted counterpart of `OS1`; so, it will be `REDH`
  on Ubuntu and `CYNH` on Arch.

  These colors are extracted from `neofetch` logo colors.


  > NOTE: at the moment, OS colors are defined just for a couple of distros,
  > like Arch, Debian, EndeavourOS, Manjaro, PopOS and Ubuntu. Plus, they've
  > only really tested on Ubuntu.
  > Feel free to add other distros and test them. OS color definitions 
  > can be found in `chromasync/actions/load/color/os_colors.py`


### Composite Colors Placeholders
`chromasync` can also blends between two colors. For example `{FG:70:BG}`
means a mixture of 70% `FG` and 30% `BG`. Any of the basic colors can
be used in a composite.


### Directives
Additionally, `chromasync` looks for some directives inside the template
file. There are two types of directives:

- format directive `@fmt:` that determines how colors are replaced in
  the template. There are two available formats right now:
    - `@fmt: #hex` : `{RED}` -> `#ff0000`
    - `@fmt: hex`  : `{RED}` -> `ff0000`
- output directive `@out:` that determines where to save the generated
  scheme. If not specified, it's saved in `~/.cache/chromasync/out/`
